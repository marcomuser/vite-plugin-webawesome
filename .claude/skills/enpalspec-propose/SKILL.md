Propose a new change - create the change and generate all artifacts in one step.

I'll create a change with artifacts:
- proposal.md (what & why)
- design.md (how)
- tasks.md (implementation steps)

When ready to implement, run /enpalspec:apply

---

**Input**: The user's request should include a change name (kebab-case) OR a description of what they want to build. Optionally, include `--exploration <path>` to specify an exploration doc explicitly and skip the directory scan (e.g., `my-change --exploration openspec/explorations/explore-topic.md`).

**Steps**

1. **Load project guidance**

   ```bash
   enpalspec guidance propose --json
   ```
   If the command succeeds: apply `context` as binding project constraints throughout (tech stack, platform requirements, conventions — do NOT include in outputs); apply `instructions` as workflow-specific overrides if non-null. If it fails or returns null fields, continue normally.

2. **Parse --exploration flag**

   Check whether the argument string contains `--exploration <path>`.
   - If found: extract the path value (everything after `--exploration` up to the next flag or end of string; strip surrounding quotes if present). Store it as the explicit exploration path. The change name/description is everything before `--exploration`.
   - If not found: no explicit exploration path; proceed normally.

3. **If no clear input provided, ask what they want to build**

   Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** (open-ended, no preset options) to ask:
   > "What change do you want to work on? Describe what you want to build or fix."

   From their description, derive a kebab-case name (e.g., "add user authentication" → `add-user-auth`).

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT proceed without understanding what the user wants to build.

4. **Trivial change detection**

   Before scanning for explorations, judge whether the change is trivial. A change is trivial if:
   - The description indicates a small, localised fix: typo, rename, config value, single-line change
   - No new capabilities or spec changes are required
   - No architectural decisions are involved

   If trivial: briefly state your reasoning ("This looks like a minor change — skipping exploration check")
   and skip directly to step 6.

   If non-trivial: proceed to step 5.

5. **Exploration doc scan and gate**

   **If `--exploration <path>` was provided (step 2):**
   - Attempt to read the file at that path
   - If the file cannot be read: report "Could not read exploration doc at `<path>`. Check the path and retry." and exit without creating any artifacts
   - If found: state "Using `<path>` as exploration context (provided explicitly)" and proceed — skip the directory scan entirely
   - Use Insights & Decisions to inform all artifacts; carry Open Questions into `design.md`

   **If no `--exploration` flag was provided:**
   Scan `openspec/explorations/` (all `<yyyy-mm>/` subdirectories) for a matching exploration doc.
   Match by comparing the change name/description against:
   - Exploration filenames (the `<topic>` segment)
   - The `# Exploration: <topic>` header line inside each doc

   **Match found:**
   - If one match: state explicitly which doc you're using:
     "Using `explorations/<yyyy-mm>/exploration-<date>-<topic>.md` as context for this proposal"
   - If multiple matches: list them, select the most recent, state selection
   - Read the matched exploration doc
   - Use Insights & Decisions to inform all artifacts (do not relitigate decided questions)
   - Carry any Open Questions from the exploration into `design.md` Open Questions section

   **No match found (non-trivial change):**
   Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to ask:
   > "No exploration found for this change. It's recommended to run `/enpalspec:explore` first.
   > Continue anyway, or explore now?"

   - If user says "explore now": output "Run `/enpalspec:explore <topic>`" and exit (do NOT create artifacts)
   - If user says "continue anyway": proceed without exploration context

6. **Create the change directory**
   ```bash
   enpalspec new change "<name>"
   ```
   This creates a scaffolded change at `openspec/changes/<name>/` with `.openspec.yaml`.

7. **Get the artifact build order**
   ```bash
   enpalspec status --change "<name>" --json
   ```
   Parse the JSON to get:
   - `applyRequires`: array of artifact IDs needed before implementation (e.g., `["tasks"]`)
   - `artifacts`: list of all artifacts with their status and dependencies

8. **Create artifacts in sequence until apply-ready**

   Use the **TodoWrite tool** to track progress through the artifacts.

   Loop through artifacts in dependency order (artifacts with no pending dependencies first):

   a. **For each artifact that is `ready` (dependencies satisfied)**:
      - Get instructions:
        ```bash
        enpalspec instructions <artifact-id> --change "<name>" --json
        ```
      - The instructions JSON includes:
        - `context`: Project background (constraints for you - do NOT include in output)
        - `rules`: Artifact-specific rules (constraints for you - do NOT include in output)
        - `template`: The structure to use for your output file
        - `instruction`: Schema-specific guidance for this artifact type
        - `outputPath`: Where to write the artifact
        - `dependencies`: Completed artifacts to read for context
      - Read any completed dependency files for context
      - Create the artifact file using `template` as the structure
      - Apply `context` and `rules` as constraints - but do NOT copy them into the file
      - Show brief progress: "Created <artifact-id>"

   b. **Continue until all `applyRequires` artifacts are complete**
      - After creating each artifact, re-run `enpalspec status --change "<name>" --json`
      - Check if every artifact ID in `applyRequires` has `status: "done"` in the artifacts array
      - Stop when all `applyRequires` artifacts are done

   c. **If an artifact requires user input** (unclear context):
      - Use **AskUserQuestion tool** to clarify
      - Then continue with creation

9. **Show final status**
   ```bash
   enpalspec status --change "<name>"
   ```

**Output**

After completing all artifacts, summarize:
- Change name and location
- List of artifacts created with brief descriptions
- Exploration context used (if any)
- What's ready: "All artifacts created! Ready for implementation."
- Prompt: "Run `/enpalspec:apply` or ask me to implement to start working on the tasks."

**Artifact Creation Guidelines**

- Follow the `instruction` field from `enpalspec instructions` for each artifact type
- The schema defines what each artifact should contain - follow it
- Read dependency artifacts for context before creating new ones
- Use `template` as the structure for your output file - fill in its sections
- **IMPORTANT**: `context` and `rules` are constraints for YOU, not content for the file
  - Do NOT copy `<context>`, `<rules>`, `<project_context>` blocks into the artifact
  - These guide what you write, but should never appear in the output

**Guardrails**
- Create ALL artifacts needed for implementation (as defined by schema's `apply.requires`)
- Always read dependency artifacts before creating a new one
- If context is critically unclear, ask the user - but prefer making reasonable decisions to keep momentum
- If a change with that name already exists, ask if user wants to continue it or create a new one
- Verify each artifact file exists after writing before proceeding to next
